# About my first project on GitHub
#I planing to develop a hiking APP that includes flowing features:

1. Discover
Four scenarios need to be fulfilled : Discover new Trails and learn more about it,Find an activity to join in and Start a activity for others to enroll .
They could via the Waterfall-style content of the Home page ,it’s could be filter by tab on the top ,  like “Trail”,”activity”,

2.Navigate
1.ETA (estimated time of arrive) of next point and the end point .
2.Speed Level asset ,help user to asset their speed . (Later)
3.difficult level (collect about trail’s information ,like ascent descent (Later)

3.Achievement
1.Achievement badge, we design badge  for every official trail, user could get the badge while finish the trail.
2.Design some badge for users while meet some goals ,like ascent ten thousands meter of total .
3.Personal’s activities data summary with cool design.

4.Community:
1.Offer smoothly features for chat ,and later built in app’s own emoji
2.same like instagram and rednote .
3.build in trails&activities information under the posts.
